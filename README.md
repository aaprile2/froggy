# 'Froggy' Robot
Working on understanding components and backend code for a simple robot using the KS0446 Keyestudio Frog Robot for Arduino Graphical Programming (https://wiki.keyestudio.com/KS0446_Keyestudio_Frog_Robot_for_Arduino_Graphical_Programming). 

## Part 1: Exploring components
The first part of this project will include learning the basics about the Arduino NANO, getting LEDs and buttons to work, and then getting the provided components working:
* NANO shield (extends the pins into a 3 pin header, making it easier to connect sensor modules)
* Bluetooth module (controls the robot)
* Ultrasonic module (measures front obstacle distance) 

## Part 2: Putting it all together
